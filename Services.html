        <ul>
            <li>Phase 1: Project initiation
                The project initiation phase is the first stage of turning an abstract idea into a meaningful goal. In this stage, we develop a business case and define the project on a broad level. In order to do that, we have to determine the need for the project and create a project charter. </li>
            <li>Phase 2: Project planning
                    The project planning stage requires complete diligence as it lays out the project’s roadmap. Unless we are using a modern project management methodology like agile project management, this second phase of project management is expected to take almost half of the entire project’s timespan. In this phase, the primary tasks are identifying technical requirements, developing a detailed project schedule, creating a communication plan, and setting up goals/deliverables. </li>
            <li> Phase 3: Project execution
                The project execution stage is where our team does the actual work. As a project manager, my job is to establish efficient workflows and carefully monitor the progress of our team.
                
                Another responsibility of the project manager during this phase is to consistently maintain effective collaboration between project stakeholders. This ensures that everyone stays on the same page and the project runs smoothly without any issues.</li>
            <li> Phase 4: Project monitoring and controlling
                In the project management process, the third and fourth phases are not sequential in nature. The project monitoring and controlling phase run simultaneously with project execution, thereby ensuring that objectives and project deliverables are met.
                
                As a project manager, I make sure that no one deviates from the original plan by establishing Critical Success Factors (CSF) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI).</li>
            <li> Phase 5: Project closing
                This is the final phase of the project management process. The project closure stage indicates the end of the project after the final delivery. There are times when external talent is hired specifically for the project on contract. Terminating these contracts and completing the necessary paperwork is also the responsibility of the project manager.</li>
        </ul>
